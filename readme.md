# ![Warden](res/logo.png)

Warden³ is an open-source continuation of Warden² (now discontinued), it will remain free and
open-source in-definitively. There are absolutely no (and never will be) any promises of compatibility
nor reliability. Take this software as is; if you have any problems feel free to either make a pull request
or an issue, but keep in mind that this is an open-source, non-profit hobby project, and your issue is not
guaranteed to be fixed.
